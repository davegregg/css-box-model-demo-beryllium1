        Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities?

        You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter? No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha.

        She's a <span class="fancy-underline">contestant</span>. It's sorta like an <mark title="'inner beauty pageant' is defined as potato.">inner beauty pageant</mark>. Ah, there it is. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. <img src="./day22-owl.svg" alt="Cute Owl"> Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby… it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did.

        I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man.

        Steve Holt? The moron jock? Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar.
